# ProgramFormatter
Ascend Program Formatter

This is a simple windows forms application that takes data in a pre-defined excel format and outputs a new excel worksheet within
the same workbook or separate workbook with the data formatted for easier consumption.

The output of the data is for each selected training block.

Limitations:
1. The training data must be in a pre-defined format
2. There are constraints for the data type in certain fields, i.e. weight, reps, sets
3. The data will write to pre-defined calculated columns based on the week. Week 3 and 4 will appear on the right even if week 1 is not defined.
